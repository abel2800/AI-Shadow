ICON PLACEHOLDER

To complete the desktop app setup, you need to add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon.png  - 512x512 PNG (for all platforms and fallback)
2. icon.ico  - Windows icon file
3. icon.icns - macOS icon file

You can create these icons using:
- Online tools: https://icongenerator.org/
- Photoshop/GIMP/Figma for PNG
- CloudConvert for format conversion

Recommended design:
- Dark/light gradient background
- Shadow or companion symbol
- Mental health friendly colors (blues, purples, calming tones)
- Simple, recognizable design

Once you have your icons, replace this placeholder file with the actual icon files.

For now, the app will work but may show a default/blank icon.
